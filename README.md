# podcastplayer
Not really going for the most useful thing, I just tried to learn stuff along the way.
Thus, this project has drag-and-drop, RSS feed parsing, AJAX requests, and a sort-of-but-not-quite MVC design
(empty "view" and "controller" folders included).

This web-app receives a podcast's RSS feed from the user, reads it and displays the episodes it finds.
Those episodes can be dragged to a playlist, where they can be played.

It works with pretty much every podcast's RSS I have tried, except, for some reason, [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/).
